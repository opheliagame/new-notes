To measure frequency more accurately you need to spend more time.\nIt is only possible to certainly measure one of either position or momentum of a particle.\nThis is not due to a limitation of measuring devices.\nWhen the position is known accurately, the momentum becomes uncertain and vice versa.\nUncertainty principle is explained by the mathematical fact that the wave function of momentum is the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\">Fourier transform</a> of the wave function of position.\nOne possible explanation as to why this happens in below\nto know position of something you have to shine light on it\nat quantum scales, light is made of photons which have energy and momentum\nThere are two scenarios\nsmaller wavelength light will have high energy photons\ncan get a good image Δx is low but since the photon is high energy it moves the particle and Δp becomes high\nhigher wavelength light will have low energy photons\nwill get a blurry image Δx is high but since the photon is low energy it doesn't move the particle and Δp becomes low",

And while I certainly enjoy documenting things[1], more often than not, I struggle with words.\nThis website began, like a lot of things do with me, as a way of measuring progress; specifically, trying to learn how to write fragment shaders by making tiny shaders and then explaining the process as best I could by writing a small article[2]. Sadly though, I never got quite far with that series, and after <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\">chess board</a>, <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\">texture land</a>, and <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\">mondrian</a>, I continued to write more shaders but never got around to writing another article.\nThen sometime in January 2022, I decided to redesign my website every year on twitter and the current version is a continuation of this exercise with some major structural redesigns and less important visual ones[3]. It started with wanting a better workflow for writing to help me think better, and the idea of building a digital garden [4][5] really stuck with me. I am giving myself the space to not agonise over every single word and how it may sound to an external audience, and instead use writing as a way to consolidate floaty bits of thoughts that I sometimes happen to have.\nLet me then make an incomplete list of things this garden might have\n\nnotes about current projects\nhalf cooked slash uncooked ideas for new projects\nrationalizing slash historical bits, like this one, about why I do certain things\nunasked for opinions\njokes in footnotes\nmore jokes than references in footnotes\nmore incomplete lists\nlists saying &quot;lists are fun but totally pointless&quot;\n<a class=\"internal-link\" data-note-icon=\"undefined\" href=\"/on-art-made-with-software/\">on art made with software</a> poems\n\nupdate - 30/05/2023\nI have not been writing a lot or taking notes. This website is almost turning out to be just like the previous ones where I engage with it only rarely. I want to stop that and write more often even if it doesn't make sense. I want to tend to this garden. So I will try to make a habit to do this whenever I am consuming some media and integrate them into the garden at the end of the day or whenever feels right for a few seconds.\n\nPCD India is a community of creative coding enthusiasts, tech artists, designers, live coders, data nerds, musicians, architects, paper engineers and artists whose practices contain these and more elements.
